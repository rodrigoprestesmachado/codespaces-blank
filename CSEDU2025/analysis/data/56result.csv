O9qCHU9a4j4ISue;CharlieBOT;To sort the given array {5, 3, 4, 1, 2} using Heap Sort, we need to first build a max heap from the array. Then, we repeatedly swap the root of the heap with the last element of the heap and reduce the size of the heap by one, and finally, heapify the root of the heap.  The number of swaps needed to sort the array using Heap Sort is 8. So, the correct answer is: d. 8;11:12:03 - 29/05/2024;;

O9qCHU9a4j4ISue;CharlieBOT;Apologies for the confusion. Let's go through the process to verify the number of swaps needed to sort the array using Heap Sort. Given array: {5, 3, 4, 1, 2} The steps to build a max heap and sort the array using Heap Sort are as follows:  Build a max heap from the array: {5, 3, 4, 1, 2}  After heapifying the array: {5, 3, 4, 1, 2} No swaps are needed during the heapification process.   Sort the array using Heap Sort:  Swap 5 with 2: {2, 3, 4, 1, 5} (1 swap) Swap 4 with 1: {2, 3, 1, 4, 5} (1 swap) Swap 3 with 1: {2, 1, 3, 4, 5} (1 swap) Swap 2 with 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (1 swap)    The total number of swaps needed to sort the array using Heap Sort is 4. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct answer is: c. 6;11:12:23 - 29/05/2024;;
