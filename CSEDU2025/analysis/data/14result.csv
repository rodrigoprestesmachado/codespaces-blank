WisxIdRd5qah364;CharlieBOT;I see you are interested in systems programming. How can I help you with this topic? Remember that I can only help you with questions related to systems programming. If you have questions about other subjects, cut-off marks or permanence at the University, I recommend you visit the UC3M website (https://www.uc3m.es).;10:51:04 - 25/06/2024;;

a) Imprime: Animal is making a sound; Dog is barking;Cat is purring; 􏰀 
b) Imprime:Animal is making a sound; Animal is making a sound;Animal is making a sound; 
c) Da error de compilación, porque animal2 debería ser declarado como Dog. 
d) Da error de compilación, porque la sentencia ""Cat.makeSound(1)"" es incorrecta.";10:51:10 - 25/06/2024;Multiple Question Exercise;Yes

WisxIdRd5qah364;CharlieBOT;"The correct answer is: b) Imprime: Animal is making a sound; Animal is making a sound; Animal is making a sound; In the given code, the method calls are as follows:  animal1.makeSound() - This calls the makeSound() method of the Animal class, which prints ""Animal is making a sound"". animal2.makeSound() - This calls the makeSound() method of the Dog class, but since the method is not overridden in the Dog class, it calls the makeSound() method of the Animal class, which prints ""Animal is making a sound"". Cat.makeSound(1) - This is an incorrect way to call the makeSound() method of the Cat class, and it will result in a compilation error.  Therefore, the correct output is ""Animal is making a sound; Animal is making a sound; Animal is making a sound;"".";10:51:12 - 25/06/2024;;
