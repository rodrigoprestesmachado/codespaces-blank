8GCvWIH7PgyvCIV;CharlieBOT;In a linked list implementation of a stack, you only need to keep one reference, which is the reference to the top of the stack. Similarly, in a linked list implementation of a queue, you only need to keep one reference, which is the reference to the front of the queue. Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as it only requires one reference for both the stack and the queue.;14:26:43 - 14/06/2024;;

Node<Tree> n = new Node<Tree>(tree, null): This line creates a new node with the given tree and a null reference to the next node.

if(isEmpty()) { top=n; } else { tail.setNext(n); }: This condition checks if the queue is empty. If it is, the new node n becomes the top of the queue. If it's not empty, the new node n is added to the end of the queue by setting the next reference of the current tail to the new node n.

tail = n;: Regardless of whether the queue was empty or not, the tail of the queue is updated to be the new node n.

size++;: Finally, the size of the queue is incremented to reflect the addition of the new node.
