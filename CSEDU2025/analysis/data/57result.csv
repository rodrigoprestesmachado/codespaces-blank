public class LBNode {

    private LBNode right;
    (...)
    public int m() {

Select one:
a. It returns the number of nodes in the tree.
b. It always throws a NullPointerException exception.
c. It traverses the tree in preorder
d. It returns the height of the tree.";11:06:30 - 29/05/2024;"Multiple Question Exercise";Yes

o2f2DEwbtjBOjNI;CharlieBOT;The method m() implemented in the LBNode class of a binary tree returns the sum of the number of nodes in the left subtree, the number of nodes in the right subtree, and 1 for the current node. Therefore, the correct answer is: a. It returns the number of nodes in the tree. This method recursively counts the nodes in the tree by traversing it in a depth-first manner.;11:06:31 - 29/05/2024;;
o2f2DEwbtjBOjNI;User;the answer is it always throws a NullPointerExcpetion;11:07:01 - 29/05/2024;Student Correction;Yes

o2f2DEwbtjBOjNI;CharlieBOT;I'm sorry, but that is not correct. The method m() does not always throw a NullPointerException. The method is designed to recursively count the number of nodes in the tree, and it will only throw a NullPointerException if either the left or right child of a node is null and the m() method is called on it. Therefore, the correct answer is: a. It returns the number of nodes in the tree. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!;11:07:02 - 29/05/2024;;
o2f2DEwbtjBOjNI;User;pero cuando termine el right tree o el left tree siempre va a llegar a un null y nunca le han dicho que pare si es distinto de null;11:07:59 - 29/05/2024;Conceptual Questions;Yes

o2f2DEwbtjBOjNI;CharlieBOT;You are absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. The method as it is currently implemented will indeed throw a NullPointerException when it tries to access the m() method on a null left or right child. Therefore, the correct answer is: b. It always throws a NullPointerException exception. Thank you for pointing that out, and I appreciate your understanding. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!;11:08:01 - 29/05/2024;;
