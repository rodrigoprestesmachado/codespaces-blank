47yTLTX4gQxQGOO;CharlieBOT;A NullPointerException is an exception in Java that occurs when you try to access or modify an object reference that has a null value. In other words, you are trying to use a reference that is not pointing to any object. This commonly happens when you try to call a method or access a field on an object that has not been initialized or has been set to null. It's important to handle NullPointerExceptions in your code to prevent unexpected crashes.;11:05:51 - 29/05/2024;;;;
