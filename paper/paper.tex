\section{Method}

Initially, we identified four initial categories were identified for classifying
student messages with the bot, as outlined in the article "Coding with AI: How
Are Tools Like ChatGPT Being Used by Students in Foundational Programming
Courses." These initial categories are as follows: (1) Debugging Help: Messages
that seek assistance in identifying and fixing errors or understanding the
provided code snippet; (2) Code Snippet: Messages requesting a specific part
of the code, such as a function or a segment; (3) Conceptual Questions: Messages
focused on understanding concepts or algorithms rather than specific code;
and (4) Complete Solution: Messages requesting an entire solution or a complete
code snippet.
\\
Upon further exploration of the data, it was determined that four additional
categories could be added, resulting in a total of eight categories: (1)
Multiple Question Exercise: Messages where the user seeks to solve a multiple-question
exercise; (2) Student Correction: Messages where the student corrects the bot;
(3) Language Change: Messages requesting a change of language; and (4)
Uncategorized: Messages that do not fit into any of the aforementioned
categories.
\\
Subsequently, these eight categories were input into Claude.ai, accompanied by
detailed instructions on the desired structure of the input and the expected
format of the output. For each conversation in the CharlieBot log, a .csv file
was downloaded, and Claude was tasked with classifying the user messages into
one of the eight categories.

The classifications made by Claude were then manually reviewed. In cases where
there was disagreement with the classification, manual adjustments were made,
and the accuracy of Claude's classification was recorded. Each conversation
with CharlieBot was saved into a .csv file containing the original conversation,
along with two additional columns: "Classification" to denote the category and
"AI" to indicate Claude's accuracy.

As new categorizations were completed, an example was submitted to Claude's
knowledge base to enhance accuracy. Initially, Claude began with an example
representing 1\% of the total memory of its knowledge base. As classifications
were progressively completed, more examples were provided to Claude to increase
the percentage of its knowledge base occupied by relevant examples.

Upon completion of all categorizations, all resulting .csv files were consolidated
for final counts and analysis using the Pandas library. This methodology
facilitated an efficient categorization of student messages, thereby enabling
a comprehensive analysis of how tools such as ChatGPT are utilized in foundational
programming courses.

\section{Result and Discussion}

Bellow is the distribution of the messages in the categories:

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/figure1.png}}

Approximately 64\% of the messages pertain to categories associated with
critical thinking, corroborating with the findings of
\cite{10.1007/978-3-031-64299-9_20}. In contrast, around 28\% of the messages
indicate a preference among students for ready-made answers.
