qyNtGrDHG4mOCZM;CharlieBOT;"The correct answer is: d. Professor p = new Person(); 
In this assignment, the data types are incompatible because you cannot assign an instance of a superclass (Person) to a variable of a subclass (Professor). The correct assignment would be the other way around, where you assign an instance of a subclass to a variable of a superclass.";11:00:32 - 29/05/2024;;
