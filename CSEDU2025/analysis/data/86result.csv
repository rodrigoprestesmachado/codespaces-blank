j3ZRuDLH8K9edOY;User;"Section 1.1. Interface PrintableBet (0.4 points):
● The interface should contain the void showDetails() method, which does 
not return any attribute in its output and only displays information 
about the bets on the console; and double calculatePayout() method, 
which returns an integer with a payout calculation.
Section 1.2. Class GeneralBet Class (0.6 points):
● Declare the GeneralBet class that will contain basic information about 
each bet. Implement the PrintableBet interface.
● The GeneralBet class allows modeling attributes common to all bets: a 
decimal number with the amount bet in euros (amount) and a string with 
the bettor's ID number (dni).
● Declare a constructor for the class that receives the necessary values 
to initialize a bet (amount and dni).
● Add a showDetails() method that displays all the information of the 
bet on the console: the bet amount and the bettor's ID number.
Note: It is not necessary to implement the get and set methods (you can 
assume they exist).
Note 2: In this class only one of the two methods declared in the 
interface is required to be implemented.";17:47:09 - 28/05/2024;Complete Solution;Yes

j3ZRuDLH8K9edOY;CharlieBOT;"Your implementation of the GeneralBet class is almost correct, but 
there is a small mistake in the showDetails() method. The print statement 
has incorrect quotation marks. Here's the corrected version:

public abstract class GeneralBet implements PrintableBet {
    private double amount;
    private String dni;
    
    public GeneralBet(double amount, String dni) {
        this.amount = amount;

        System.out.println(""The bettor's id number is: "" + dni);
    }

With this correction, your GeneralBet class now correctly implements the

Section 1.3. HorseBet Class (1.0 points):
● Declare the HorseBet class, which is a specialization of the GeneralBet 
class.
● The HorseBet class has additional information: a string with the name 
of the horse (horse) and an integer with the race number (race). Declare 
a constructor for the class that receives as parameters: the bet amount, 
bettor's ID number, horse name, and race number.
● Add the showDetails() method that displays all the information of the 
bet on the console: the bet amount, bettor's ID number, horse name, and 
race number.
● Add the calculatePayout() method that calculates the money that should 
be paid to the bettor in case of winning the race. This method should 
return a double with the bet amount multiplied by six.";18:08:42 - 28/05/2024;Debugging Help;Yes

j3ZRuDLH8K9edOY;CharlieBOT;"Your HorseBet class is almost correct, but there are a few issues that 
need to be addressed. First, the constructor is missing the keyword 
""HorseBet"" and the parameters should be properly defined. Second, the 
print statements in the showDetails() method have incorrect quotation 
marks. Here's the corrected version:

public class HorseBet extends GeneralBet {
    private String horse;
    private int race;
    
    public HorseBet(double amount, String dni, String horse, int race) {
        super(amount, dni);
